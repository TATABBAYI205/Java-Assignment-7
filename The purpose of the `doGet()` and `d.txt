|                |                                                   |                                                      |
| Request Data   | Parameters and data are appended in the URL.      | Parameters and data are sent in the body of the      |
|                |                                                   | request.                                             |
| Visibility in  | Data is visible in the URL.                       |  Data is not visible in the URL.                     |
| URL            |                                                   |                                                      |

| Idempotence    | The `doGet()` method is considered idempotent,    | The `doPost()` method is not necessarily idempotent, |
|                | meaning multiple identical requests should produce| as it can perform non-idempotent operations like data| 
|                | the same result.                                  | insertion or updates.                                |

| Usage          | Typically used for retrieving data, displaying    | Typically used for submitting form data, performing  |
|                | information, or rendering views.                  | data modifications, or invoking server-side actions. |
|                |                                                   |                                                      |

        These methods, `doGet()` and `doPost()`, are part of the Servlet service implementation and allow developers to handle different types of HTTP requests in a Servlet. The appropriate method is chosen based on the HTTP method used in the client's request.
